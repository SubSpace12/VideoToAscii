# Video to Ascii Converter

This is one of the two projects I made to learn Rust. It takes a video, converts every frame into an ASCII image using an FFMPEG crate, and displays it using a simple Python script.

Whenever I have the time, I plan on moving the front-end into Rust to, as well as adding sound to the output.

To run, insert a video into the folder with the name "rust.mp4", then run the Rust script.
